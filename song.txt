In the night, I hear 'em talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things, but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But, in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
